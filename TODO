Basically you can help porting the mess from the old over-architectured OO layout 
to the new class layout.

  done: Simple and partially Pointer
  todo: Array, Struct, Field, Union, and fix the "not so simple" Simple types.

I had no time lately, but beginning with fall 2011 I quit my perl-less dayjob
and start with a perl core-only job at cPanel, so I will have a lot of time to
finish Ctypes and types and fix some remaining compiler bugs.
