Ctypes

Call and wrap native C functions and libraries from Perl, using only
Perl.

This module requires the C library libffi to run. If you're on a unix-
like system, you should install this via your favoured package
manager. If you're on Win32 (using Strawberry Perl) you should go
download the libffi-3.0.9 sources yourself from the following URL,
compile the libraries and put them somewhere your Strawberry compiler
toolchain will find them when it needs to. I can't remember just now
whether the Strawberry toolchain is sufficient to compile libffi; you
might be lucky.

http://sourceware.org/libffi/

Ctypes (current v0.001) is based on libffi to provide a way of calling
native C library functions directly from Perl, using only Perl, and
hence not requiring a compiler.

Of course, the Ctypes module itself is written with XS. Haven't really
thought that one through entirely. Perhaps we'll provide binaries? Or
perhaps (wonder of wonders) it could someday be rolled into Perl5 core?

INSTALLATION

This module uses ExtUtils::ModuleMaker because I couldn't see how to
get Module::Build to compile stuff the way I wanted. Module::Install
is currently still a bit limited for this fancy stuff too. So what
you do is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
