Ctypes

Call and wrap native C functions and libraries from Perl, using only
Perl.

Ctypes (current v0.003) is based on libffi to provide a way of calling
native C library functions directly from Perl, using only Perl, and
hence not requiring a compiler.

Of course, the Ctypes module itself is written with XS, so you need 
a compiler to install this module from source.
Orperhaps (wonder of wonders) it could someday be rolled into Perl5 core?

This module requires the C library libffi to run. If you're on a POSIX
system, libffi should have been installed this via your favoured package
manager, otherwise we will build and install it for you into /usr/local. 
If you're on Win32 there are pre-compiled libffi binaries included.

INSTALLATION

This module uses ExtUtils::ModuleMaker because I couldn't see how to
get Module::Build to compile stuff the way I wanted. Module::Install
is currently still a bit limited for this fancy stuff too. So what
you do is:

	perl Makefile.PL [INCDIR=libffi-include-path LIBDIR=libffi-lib-path]
	make
	make test
	make install

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
